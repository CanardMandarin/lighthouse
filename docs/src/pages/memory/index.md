## Summary

The **MemoryWrite** and **MemoryClose** instructions are used to store arbitrary data into a "memory" account owned by the Lighthouse program. This is useful for storing snapshots of data and making assertions about what was stored in the memory account and compare it to the state of the account at the end of the transaction.

[MemoryWrite](/memory/write) (Write data to a memory account)

[MemoryClose](/memory/close) (Close a memory account)
