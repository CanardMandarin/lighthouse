If you are a Rust developer, you can also use a Rust client SDK to interact with the Token Metadata program. Metaplex provides a dedicated Rust client crate, which is a lightweight crate with minimal dependencies.

To get started, you'll need to add the `mpl-inscription` dependency to your project. From a terminal on the root folder of your project:
```
cargo add mpl-inscription
```
This will all the latest version of the crate in your project's dependency list.
